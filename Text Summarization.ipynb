      " In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans. Neural networks can be applied to the problem of intelligent control (for robotics) or learning, using such techniques as Hebbian learning (\"fire together, wire together\"), GMDH or competitive learning. Artificial intelligence can be classified into three different types of systems: analytical, human-inspired, and humanized artificial intelligence. IBM has created its own artificial intelligence computer, the IBM Watson, which has beaten human intelligence (at some levels). Musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as Google DeepMind and Vicarious to \"just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence. Many of the problems in this article may also require general intelligence, if machines are to solve the problems as well as people do. \"robotics\" or \"machine learning\"), the use of particular tools (\"logic\" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.\n"
